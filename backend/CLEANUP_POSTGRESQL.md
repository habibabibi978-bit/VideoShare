# Cleanup PostgreSQL - Fresh Start Guide

## What We're Cleaning Up

1. ✅ PostgreSQL services (already uninstalled)
2. ✅ PostgreSQL installation folders (check if any remain)
3. ✅ PostgreSQL-related scripts and documentation
4. ✅ Old database configuration in .env

## After Cleanup

You'll have a clean slate to:
- Install PostgreSQL fresh
- Set it up with default port 5432
- Configure it properly from the start

## Next Steps After Cleanup

1. Install PostgreSQL 18 (or latest version)
2. Use default port 5432 during installation
3. Set a password you'll remember
4. Create the database
5. Update .env file with correct credentials
